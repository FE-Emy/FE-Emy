## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am studying full-stack development with a focus on both front-end and back-end technologies. I have a strong passion for web design and front-end development, while also working on building robust back-end solutions. I am committed to honing my skills in both areas to create complete and efficient applications. I am open to discussions and job opportunities in the web and software development fields â€“ feel free to reach out for collaborations and job offers!
